    /*
    An iframe, short for "inline frame," is an HTML element used to embed another HTML document
    within the current document. It allows you to display content from another web page or website
    directly within your own page. This is commonly used for embedding videos, maps, or other external
    content onto a webpage without having to directly integrate it into the page's code.

    For example, if you wanted to embed a YouTube video on your website, you could use an iframe to
    display the video player directly within your webpage by specifying the URL of the video in the iframe's `src` attribute.

    Selenium controls only one HTML at a time.
    in order to deal with that you have to switchTo method do switch driver to frame.
